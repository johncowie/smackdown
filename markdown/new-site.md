New Year, New Site

meta, blog, code

I've decided to try and reinvigorate my blog a bit by replacing the framework behind it.
With an infrastructure in place that I've written myself I'm much more likely to update it
and experiment with it.  Wordpress is great, but I hate PHP - so I decided to make a static
site generator with [Clojure](http://clojure.org), which is much more fun to write.
